# Django Project Template

ðŸš€ **Welcome to your new Django project!**

This template provides a modern, well-structured Django project with best practices built-in.

## What's Included

- âœ… Clean project structure with separated concerns
- âœ… Sample app with CRUD operations
- âœ… Bootstrap 5 UI components
- âœ… Pre-configured templates
- âœ… Test suite setup
- âœ… Management commands
- âœ… uv package manager integration
- âœ… Project customization script

## Quick Start

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Customize your project structure** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python customize_template.py your_project_name
   ```
   This renames the `project/` folder to your custom name and updates all references.

3. **Set up your environment**:

   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize your database**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py create_sample_people --count 5
   ```

5. **Start developing**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
